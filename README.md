# ID Card Generator

This Google Apps Script automates the creation of ID cards using data from a Google Form. It integrates Google Sheets, Google Slides, and Google Drive to generate and store ID cards as PDFs.

## Features

- **Form Integration**: Collects ID card details (Name, Date of Birth, Address, etc.) from a Google Form.
- **Google Sheets**: Stores responses from the form.
- **Google Slides**: Uses a predefined slide template to generate ID cards.
- **Google Drive**: Saves generated ID cards as PDFs in a specified folder.

## How It Works

1. The script fetches data from a Google Sheet (`Form Responses 2`).
2. For each entry:
   - A copy of the Google Slides template is made.
   - Placeholders (like `{{Name}}`, `{{Date of Birth}}`) are replaced with actual data.
   - The image placeholder (`image-holder`) is replaced with the user's image from a Google Drive URL.
3. The final ID card is saved as a PDF in Google Drive and named after the individual.

## Google Apps Script

### Function: `generateIDCards()`

The `generateIDCards()` function performs the following tasks:

- Opens the Google Sheet with form responses.
- Iterates through each row, creating a copy of the slide template for each user.
- Replaces placeholders with user details, including images.
- Saves each ID card as a PDF in Google Drive.
- Deletes the temporary slide copy after exporting the PDF.

### Placeholder Details
The placeholders in the slide template include:
- `{{Name}}`: Name of the individual
- `{{Std}}`: Standard or class
- `{{Date of Birth}}`: Date of birth
- `{{Father Name}}`: Fatherâ€™s name
- `{{Mobile Number}}`: Mobile number
- `{{Address L1}}`: First line of the address
- `{{Address L2}}`: Second line of the address
- `{{City}}`: City name
- `{{Pincode}}`: Postal code
- `{{School}}`: School name
- `{{b}}`: Additional placeholder if needed
- `{{ID}}`: Student or individual ID

## Requirements

- Google Drive folder for saving PDFs.
- Google Sheets for storing form responses.
- Google Slides for the ID card template.
